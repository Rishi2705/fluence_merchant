# Fluence Pay Logo

**IMPORTANT:** Please add the Fluence Pay logo image files here as:
- **fluence_logo.png** (for the splash screen)
- **fluence_logo_second.png** (for the signup screen)

The logos should be in PNG format with transparent background for best results.

**Steps to add the logos:**
1. Save your Fluence Pay splash logo as `fluence_logo.png`
2. Save your Fluence Pay signup logo as `fluence_logo_second.png`
3. Place both files directly in the `assets/images/` folder
4. The screens will automatically display your logos

**Recommended logo specifications:**
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Splash logo size: 200x200px or similar square dimensions
- Signup logo size: 120x120px or similar square dimensions
- File names: exactly `fluence_logo.png` and `fluence_logo_second.png` (case sensitive)

Once you add the logo file, run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter run` to see your splash screen with the actual logo.
